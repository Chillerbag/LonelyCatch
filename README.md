# Lonely Catch

### Context
---
I made this game over 9/03/2025 - 10/03/2025 (a little less than a day). For the CISSA x GMC Game Jam of which the theme was "A world without humans". 
It was a fun way to learn the SDK in a really small time, and I was happy with what I was able to learn in the timeframe. It was also my first major Lua project. Cool language! The C FFI is particularly cool and its impressive how fast it is. Truly a bare bones scripting language. 
</br></br> Anyway, the game isn't a masterpiece of design, but its fun enough for the context of the device. I probably wont end up submitting, because i sincerely doubt many people can even play it, because the Playdate is kinda niche.
</br></br> Have fun!
### Story 
---
All the humans are gone and now a small storage robot has nothing to do except play catch with itself in the Pit of Parcels.

### Gameplay

Lonely Catch is a arcade style game about bouncing a ball around. Go for more daring catches to earn a higher score multiplier, or just bounce the ball around and then catch for a simple score.

### Controls

- Press **Left and Right D Pad** to move Left and Right.
- Once the ball is shot, rotate the **Crank** to aim the bouncer arm to continue bouncing the ball.
- Once ready to catch, press **Down on the D Pad** to switch to the catcher arm.
- Press the **B Button** To perform a dash once the ball has been shot.
